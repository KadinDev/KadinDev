## 🚀 About me

Mobile developer specialized in React Native, focused on building reliable and scalable production applications.

My work goes beyond creating screens — I design maintainable architectures, reusable design systems and stable user experiences. I care deeply about performance, consistency and long-term maintainability of the codebase.

I have hands-on experience building real applications involving authentication, async data synchronization, subscriptions and backend integration.

Main expertise:
• React Native + TypeScript
• Design Systems & component architecture
• Complex animations (Reanimated)
• Async state management (TanStack Query)
• Authentication flows & form handling
• Unit, Integration and E2E testing
• CI/CD pipelines and automated builds
• Supabase integration

I’m comfortable collaborating with backend services and have additional experience with Node.js, Firebase and React.
