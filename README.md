## 🚀 About me

I’m a mobile developer focused on React Native, always looking to build apps that genuinely solve everyday problems.
I like to think of practical and efficient solutions, and I’m constantly learning to improve what I already know — whether it’s testing new libraries, refining architecture, or optimizing the user experience.
